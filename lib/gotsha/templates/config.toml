# Test commands
# 
# This is where you define your test commands.
# A "test command" is any bash command.
# Multiple (comma-separated) commands supported

commands = [
  # Your first test command goes into the parentheses!

  # See some examples:
  #  "bin/rails t",

  #  "npm test"
  #  "npx jest --ci"
  #  "pytest -q"

# Git hooks config
#
# Set when Gotsha should run your tests automatically. Every
# test run stores the test results to the commit.
#
# If you decide to not use any hooks,
# you can create sign-off commit manually by this command:
#
# ```
#
#   gotsha commmit
