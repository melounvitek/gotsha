# Test commands

# This is where you define what tests to run and how.
# Multiple (comma-separated) commands supported, see the
# commented examples:
#
commands = [
#  "bundle exec rspec --order rand",
#  "rubocop",
#  "docker exec -it great-app rspec"

# Git hooks config
#
# Set when Gotsha should run your tests automatically. Every
# test run stores the test results to the commit.
#
# If you decide to not use any hooks,
# you can create sign-off commit manually by this command:
#
# ```
#   gotsha commmit
# ```
#
